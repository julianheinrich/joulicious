## Information

- **Cook Time:** 5 minutes
- **Total Time:** 10 minutes
- **Servings:** 2
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Tags:** breakfast, vegetarian, quick, kid-friendly

## Ingredients

- 4 [large eggs](../ingredients/eggs.md)
- 2 tablespoons [milk](../ingredients/milk.md) or cream
- 1 tablespoon [butter](../ingredients/butter.md)
- [Salt](../ingredients/salt.md) and [pepper](../ingredients/pepper.md) to taste
- Optional: [shredded cheese](../ingredients/cheese-cheddar.md), chopped herbs (chives, parsley)

## Equipment

- Non-stick skillet or frying pan
- Mixing bowl
- Whisk or fork
- Spatula

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the eggs:** Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl. Add milk or cream, salt, and pepper.

2. **Whisk:** Beat the eggs with a whisk or fork until well combined and slightly frothy. The more you whisk, the fluffier they'll be.

3. **Heat the pan:** Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter and let it melt, coating the bottom of the pan.

4. **Cook the eggs:** Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Let it sit for about 20 seconds without stirring.

5. **Scramble:** Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges. Continue this process, stirring occasionally.

6. **Finish cooking:** When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly wet (they'll continue cooking from residual heat), remove from heat.

7. **Serve:** Transfer to plates immediately. Add cheese or herbs if desired.

## Tips

- **Don't overcook:** Remove eggs from heat when they're still slightly undercooked - they'll finish cooking on the plate
- **Low and slow:** Cook on medium-low heat for creamier eggs
- **Add-ins:** Stir in cheese, diced vegetables, or cooked bacon for variety
- **Dairy-free option:** Use plant-based milk and oil instead of dairy milk and butter
